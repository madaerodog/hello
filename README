Hello, and welcome to my playground for testing the git functionality!

If you are new to Git you should start your journey by understanding what a repository is and how to create one by following this guides 

https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/

Now that you know how to create a repository it is important to see how can you contribute to other developers repositories.

So I made this repository in my early days https://github.com/madaerodog/hello and you have to contribute with a file to it.

Read this resource on how to do that https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo

You will use your own account to fork his repository, add a file with your username in small caps from here and in it put a message for me (be careful it is a public message :).

Submit a pull request to send the file to my repository to finish the challenge.
